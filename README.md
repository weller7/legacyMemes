# Legacy Memes
Create memes from the video game Hogwarts Legacy using pictures and adding text.

**Link to project:** http://legacy-memes.vercel.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite.

I used React to create an app that renders a random image taken from an object of Hogwarts Legacy images and the user can add top and bottom text to the image using the form, if the user wants another image they can click the button and a new image will be selected randomy from the array and displayed on the app.  

## Optimizations
Creating an API that loads images from different sources and have a lot more variety instead of using an object.

## Lessons Learned:
Creating components, using forms in React and using Vite as a development server.
